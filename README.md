Hi, my name is Robert

I aspire to be a data analyst and eventually to become a data scientist by the age of 33. 
I found the interest during the circuit-breaker period (Singapore's version of nation-wide lockdown in response to the corona virus pandemic) as I was tasked to be part of a research team, in the company, to perform research on business procurement expansion and rubber property projects. The research gave me ample opportunities to play with data analytics and visualization. Through the projects, I realized that I wanted more and I wanted to dive deeper into the data analytics world. So here I am.
