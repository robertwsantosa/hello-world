Hi, my name is Robert
I aspire to be a data analyst and eventually to become an data scientist in the near future. 
It all started while I was part of a research team, in my current company, that perform research on natural rubber business expansion project. The research allowed me to perform basic data analytics and visualization. Through the process, I realized that I found great interests in going much much deeper into data analytics world. So here I am.
